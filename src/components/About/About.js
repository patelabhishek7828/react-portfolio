              {/* My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion for problem-solving, which led me to pursue the Computer Systems Technology program. Despite its challenges, I remained determined and forged lasting friendships that supported me throughout this demanding program.
            Throughout my studies at BCIT, I had the opportunity to engage in fascinating projects. Notably, I contributed to the development of the RENR Safety App and MyMind, projects that garnered recognition from my colleagues, instructors, and clients alike. */}
              With over 4 years of work experience, including more than 2.5 years in front-end development using React Native and React JS, I have gained valuable expertise in building web and mobile applications. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Sagar Institute of Research and Technology-Excellence and began my career as a Mechanical Engineer. Currently, I am working as a Front-End Developer at Apcom Infotech in Noida, where I have contributed to notable projects, including the Cars360 mobile app for buying and selling used cars. At present, I am working on a React-based eCommerce website, further expanding my skills in web development.
